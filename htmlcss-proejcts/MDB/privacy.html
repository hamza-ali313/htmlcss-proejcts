            <h2>Star MD Billing Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Effective From: October 2, 2023</strong></p>
            <h3>SCOPE AND PURPOSE</h3>
            <p>This privacy policy (“Policy”) outlines how Star MD Billing and its affiliated companies, subsidiaries, and parent companies (referred to as “Star MD Billing,” “we,” “us,” “our,”) collect, use, and disclose information obtained from you through various websites and applications, including [URL], that link to this Policy (collectively referred to as the “Sites”). This Policy also governs the collection of information that occurs offline, such as when you visit our physical offices, attend Star MD Billing events, or interact with our representatives at other events, or in any other circumstances where this Policy is made available to you.</p>
            <p>The terms of this Policy are not applicable to Star MD Billing product offerings that have separate privacy policies or to third-party websites that we may link to. We have no control over and cannot be held responsible for the privacy practices of third-party websites. Therefore, we advise you to review any relevant privacy policies of these third-party websites independently.</p>
            <p>Star MD Billing processes data on behalf of healthcare providers in accordance with the agreements we have with our customers. These agreements may require Business Associate Agreements as per the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”). Your healthcare provider may have its own policies and practices regarding the collection and use of your data. We are not responsible for how your healthcare provider handles your information, and it is advisable that you review their privacy policies.</p>
            <h3>WHAT ARE THE SERVICES OR FUNCTIONS PROVIDED BY STAR MD BILLING?</h3>
            <p>Star MD Billing, headquartered in the United States, is a company that provides network-enabled services to healthcare, hospital, and ambulatory customers across the country. Our healthcare cloud-based solutions provide healthcare providers with various options such as electronic health records, patient engagement tools, and revenue cycle management. For further details regarding Star MD Billing, kindly refer to the “About” section on our website.</p>
            <h3>WHAT KIND OF PERSONAL DATA DO WE GATHER?</h3>
            <p>Personal information is data that can be utilized to identify an individual. The specific types of personal information we gather depend on the nature of your interactions with us. In the last 12 months, we have obtained personal information that falls under the following broad categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identifiers, which includes details like your name, email address, or IP address.</li>
                <li>Information from our customer records, like your postal address or phone number.</li>
                <li>Commercial information, such as information regarding products or services that you have purchased.</li>
                <li>Electronic network activity information, such as your engagement with our website.</li>
                <li>Professional or employment-related information, such as your job title or employer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Geolocation data, which may include general location information (such as city/state) derived from your IP address or precise location information obtained via GPS-based functionality. In cases where we require precise geolocation information, we will seek your permission to collect or use it, in accordance with relevant legal requirements, particularly if it is classified as “sensitive” information under applicable law.</p>
            <h3>THROUGH WHAT MEANS DO WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</h3>
            <p>We may obtain your personal information in various ways, which include the following:</p>
            <p>Information that you directly provide to us, such as when you voluntarily fill out fields on the Sites, request specific services or information, participate in surveys, or contact our customer service. Depending on how you interact with us, we may ask for details like your name, organization/practice name, email address, phone number, and user type (e.g., patient, provider, partner). If you have an account with us, we may also collect login information like your username or Practice ID. If you attend our physical events or visit our offices, we may ask for information such as health and travel details to ensure the safety of our personnel, clients, guests, and the public.</p>
            <p>Automatic data collection technologies, like those mentioned in the “Cookies and Automated Data Collection Technologies” section below, may be used to collect information about your device and your visit to our Sites. This data may include your IP address, geolocation, browser type, device type, mobile device identifiers, and activity reflecting your browsing history on our Sites (such as mouse movements, clicks, touches, scrolls, and keystrokes).</p>
            <p>Information from other sources, such as lead generation companies, social networks, or business partners offering co-branded services or assisting with the sale or distribution of our products, may also be collected. We may also obtain information from other users of our services or publicly available sources.</p>
            <h3>IN WHAT WAYS DO WE UTILIZE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</h3>
            <p>We utilize your personal information in the following ways:</p>
            <p>In ways that are expected based on the reason for collecting it. For instance, if you contact us with a request for information, we will use your information to respond to your request. To provide, enhance, and improve our services, including optimizing our Sites’ functionality and identifying areas of interest for our visitors and users. Feedback from surveys, screeners, and other feedback mechanisms may be used to develop new products and services. To identify and authenticate you as an existing user or a prospective client. To enable cross-device/cross-context tracking for your account(s). To communicate with you through emails, newsletters, announcements, and other types of communication. To maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our Sites and services, and for legal compliance purposes. To ensure the safety of our personnel, clients, guests, and the public. For purposes explained at the time of collection or other business purposes consistent with the context of the collection.   </p>
            <p>We may use non-identifiable information (such as aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified data) for any purpose that is not prohibited by applicable law.</p>
            <h3>IN WHAT WAYS DO WE DISCLOSE OR EXCHANGE YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</h3>
            <p> The personal information we reveal for commercial purposes falls into these categories: identifiers, commercial data, internet activity, and geolocation data.</p>
            <p>We may share your personal information outside of Star MD Billing in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We may share your personal information with external service providers and vendors who offer us services, such as analytics, content management, advertisement administration, marketing-related insights, market research, and marketing efforts analysis.</li>
                <li>We may collaborate with third-party providers who offer audience matching services. For example, we utilize the Facebook pixel on our non-patient-facing Sites and may share your email address with a social media service to aid in our social media marketing services. This enables us to locate additional potential customers with interests similar to yours. Some technology services may provide their own data to us, which we then upload into another technology service to identify common factors among those data sets.</li>
                <li>We may share your personal information with our affiliates and related entities for business purposes, such as customer support, marketing, technical operations, and other business operations. We may also reveal your information to affiliates for commercial purposes.</li>
                <li>If you make your information accessible or public to other users of the Sites, such as through posting reviews related to partners or other content, you should exercise caution as you are responsible for the content you post and how others may use it. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to modify or remove it.</li>
                <li>We may disclose your personal information with our customers when you participate in our surveys as an authorized user, during the onboarding process, when providing feedback on our services, surveys conducted post-interaction with our support or training teams, and other surveys, such as focus groups and usability design activities like click tests, card sorts, and other tests and surveys in which you participate. If you complete a survey, we usually inform you beforehand that we will share your information with our customers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may also reveal your information to other entities in the following situations: When you provide us with your consent to share or utilize information about you; When we believe it is necessary to share information about you to fulfill a service you have requested from us or others; When we are legally obligated or compelled to disclose information, such as in response to a lawful request by public authorities or to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; When we deem it necessary to prevent legal violations or liability; To safeguard the rights, property, life, health, security, or safety of ourselves, the Sites, or anyone else; In the event of an actual or potential purchase, merger, or acquisition of all or a part of our business by an actual or potential buyer (and their agents and advisers); At your request or direction, such as when you elect to share information about your activities on the Sites with a social network; or With any other party with your consent and advance notice of the disclosure.</p>
            <p>However, we may still disclose information that does not identify you and could not reasonably be used to identify you (including aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified data) as allowed by relevant laws. Concerning de-identified patient information, we only share such data with third parties if it is authorized under our agreements with our clients and is in accordance with the requirements of HIPAA or other applicable laws. We use either the safe harbor method or the expert determination method as set out in HIPAA. The third parties who receive the de-identified data include third-party vendors and service providers with whom we have partnerships or relationships, as well as academic researchers and institutions that contribute to the healthcare industry.</p>
            <h3>HOW DO WE SAFEGUARD AND RETAIN DATA</h3>
            <p>We safeguard your information using various security measures, including encryption for sensitive information. However, we can’t guarantee that your information is completely secure. We keep information for different periods depending on why we collected it, and we won’t keep it longer than needed unless required by law. Sometimes we may be unable to delete or de-identify your information for technical or operational reasons, but we’ll take steps to prevent further processing.</p>

            <p>Third parties whom this data was disclosed, shared, or sold: service providers, third party partners, our related entities, other users through the Sites because you made your information public or otherwise accessible, with our customers, where you have given us your consent.</p>
            <p>If you are a California resident, you may have the following rights with respect to the personal information we process about you:</p>
            <ul>

            <p>You, or a legally authorized representative, may submit a verifiable consumer request regarding your personal information. If you are making a request on behalf of a minor child, you may do so as well. To verify your identity, we may request information from you. We may require you to use your email address to verify your identity. Once we receive a request, we will respond within the time period required by law. Some information may be exempt from requests. If we deny your request, you have the right to appeal the decision. You may make a consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.

However, if we need more time (up to 90 days), we will let you know the reason for the delay and the extended timeline through email or written communication. It’s important to note that any disclosures we provide will only pertain to the 12-month period leading up to the consumer request. Additionally, if we cannot fulfill a request, we will provide an explanation as to why we are unable to do so.</p>
